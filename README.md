# timed-coding-quiz

## Description

In this project, we built a timed JavaScript fundamentals quiz with multiple choice questions. Time is subtracted from the timer for wrong answers and the user is able to save their initials and score at the end of the quiz. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and JavaScript code that we wrote.  

During this project, I continued to learn about basic JavaScript function and dynamic updates.
